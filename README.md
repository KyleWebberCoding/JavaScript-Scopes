# JavaScript-Scopes
This repository is for learning the basics of JavaScript scopes.

- Scope refers to where variables can be accessed throughout the program, and is determined by where and how they are declared.
- Blocks are statements that exist within curly braces {}.
- Global scope refers to the context within which variables are accessible to every part of the program.
- Global variables are variables that exist within the global scope.
- Block scope refers to the limited reach of variables that are only available within the specific code block where they are defined.
- Local variables are variables that exist within the block scope.
- Global namespace is the space in our code that contains globally scoped information.
- Scope pollution is when too many variables exist in a namespace or variable names are reused.
